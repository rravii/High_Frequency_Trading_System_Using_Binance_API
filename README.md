## High Frequency Trading System
High-frequency trading (HFT) refers to the practice of using advanced computer algorithms and high-speed trading infrastructure to execute large numbers of trades in financial markets within very short time frames, typically measured in milliseconds or microseconds. HFT systems aim to capitalize on small price discrepancies and market inefficiencies that exist for very brief periods.

## Trading Algorithm And Strategy:
In the context of trading algorithms, SMA (Simple Moving Average) and RSI (Relative Strength Index) can be used as indicators to generate trading signals. These signals can be used to determine when to buy or sell an asset. For example, a trading algorithm may be programmed to buy an asset when the price crosses above its SMA line or when the RSI falls below a certain threshold indicating oversold conditions.

Buy Limit Orders, on the other hand, are order types that can be utilized in trading algorithms to execute trades. By placing a buy limit order, the algorithm sets a specific price at which it wants to buy an asset. Once the market price reaches or falls below the specified limit price, the order is triggered and the trade is executed automatically.
